I reached the pinnicle success in the business world.In others eyes,my life was an epitome of success.However,aside from work, I have little joy.In the end,wealth is only a fact of life that i'm accustomed to.At this moment,lying on the sick bed and recalling my whole life,i realise that all the recognition and wealth i took so much pride in,have paled and become meaningless in the face of inpeading dealth. In the darkness,i look at the green lights from the life supporting machines,and hear the humming mechanical sounds.I can feel the dealth of god of death drawing closer.Now i know,when we have accumulated sufficient wealth to last our lifetime,we should pursue other matters that are unrelated to wealth.Should be something that is more important.Perhaps relationships,perhaps art,perhaps a dream from your younger days.Non-stop pursueing of wealth will only turn a person into a twisted being.

Just try your best to be the guy whose achievements can revolutionize the world.
